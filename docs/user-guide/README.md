# Meridia User Guide – Knowledge Base Drafts (Product Fruits)

Source of truth: `maritime-analytics-frontend-develop.zip` (v1.11.0). Steps are derived from the UI code (labels, validation rules, toasts), so wording matches the screen. Items marked **[CONFIRM]** depend on backend/email behaviour that cannot be verified from front-end code.

## Article format (one article per task)
Title → Before you begin → Numbered steps (one action each, UI labels in **bold**) → Expected result → Troubleshooting → `[SCREENSHOT n]` markers.

## Screenshot priority
1. **P1 (POC):** Login page, Login filled in, MFA code screen, Reset – enter email, Reset – code + new password (incl. requirements tooltip), success toast on Login, landing page after login.
2. **P2:** My Account → Security (Change password, MFA), Logout control.
3. **P3:** Every module's main screen, plus any modal, dropdown, filter panel or export dialog (these are the places users get stuck).

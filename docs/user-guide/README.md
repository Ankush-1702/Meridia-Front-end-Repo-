# Meridia User Guide – Knowledge Base Drafts (Product Fruits)

Source of truth: `maritime-analytics-frontend-develop.zip` (v1.11.0). Steps are derived from the UI code (labels, validation rules, toasts), so wording matches the screen. Items marked **[CONFIRM]** depend on backend/email behaviour that cannot be verified from front-end code.

## Article format (one article per task)
Title → Before you begin → Numbered steps (one action each, UI labels in **bold**) → Expected result → Troubleshooting → `[SCREENSHOT n]` markers.

## Module map (proposed KB structure)

## Screenshot priority
1. **P1 (POC):** Login page, Login filled in, MFA code screen, Reset – enter email, Reset – code + new password (incl. requirements tooltip), success toast on Login, landing page after login.
2. **P2:** My Account → Security (Change password, MFA), Logout control.
3. **P3:** Every module's main screen, plus any modal, dropdown, filter panel or export dialog (these are the places users get stuck).

## Notes for customers audience
- No admin-only screens exist in the front end; admin-related content is limited to the read-only **Role** / **Account ID** on My Profile. MFA self-setup is commented out of the UI, so it is intentionally not documented.
- Product Fruits-ready output: `product-fruits/` (HTML articles + tour/checklist definitions).
- Screenshots: pending test-environment URL.

## Front-end issues spotted while drafting Company search
- **No standalone company search, result list, company profile or fleet view exists** – only a Beta "company contact details" lookup launched from the company icon on the five Ownership rows (Operator, Registered owner, Technical manager, Ship manager, Group beneficial owner) of the vessel details panel (Overview tab). The sidebar **Search** has no company tab.
- **No entitlement gate in the front end** – the icon shows for any non-empty ownership name (conflicts with the "entitled accounts only" decision – please confirm).
- The "DOC company" row in Registry has no company icon; the Export menu is hidden for empty results but Refresh is still shown; results are cached in the browser for 24 hours per company name + IMO; the address map silently disappears if geocoding fails; requests time out after about 160 s.
